# The Universal Book of Mormon

The Universal Book of Mormon is based on early version of the Book of Mormon which are currently Public Domain.

It was created with the goal of having a single version of the Book of Mormon that shows Chapter/Verse annotations for various common versions of the Book of Mormon currently in circulation so that no matter which versing scheme someone uses when making a reference, you can look up the passage without doing the mapping between versions yourself.

## The Universal Book of Mormon includes these versing layouts:
* The **RAV** - or *Revised Authorized Version* as published by the Community of Christ.
* The **OPV** - or *Orson Pratt Version* as published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints.

## Note:
The Book of Mormon did not originally have any verse numbers, so there are no "original" verse numbers to reference back to as being authoritative.
