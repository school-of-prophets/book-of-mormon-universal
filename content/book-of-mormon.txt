chapter-sum: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.’” – Revelation 14: 6-7 KJV

. This version of the Book of Mormon was created to help any transitioning between Latter Day Saint or Mormon denominations. The goal is to make accessing this book of scripture, with the different chaptering, versing, and sections, easier to navigate. The Book of Mormon is a sacred text for the Latter Day Saint movement. It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as “The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.” We have added “The Fullness of the Gospel, The New Covenant of Jesus Christ” to the title. Changes to the text from the original 1830 edition are in italics. In addition, as noted, differences from the King James Bible to the translation of the same books are also in italics. It is our prayer that this edition will help unify the Saints that Israel may gather, and Zion be established.
