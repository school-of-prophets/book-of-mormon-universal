contents

    Ole Nephi wrote books one and two
    then his brother, whose son's wrote a few
    some words and some kings
    then some judges and things
    then compiled to exhort me and you

introduction

    these gold plates have a story so strange
    from jerusalem westward they came
    't has all manor of "-ites"
    always getting in fights
    but in fullness the gospel 't contains 

    said young joseph, "bro's take it from me
    another book you will not find any,
    that by living its law
    'twill get you closer to God
    to our religion, yea this stone is key"

testimony of three

    through the grace of the Father and Son
    an angel to three men did come
    showed them plates made of gold
    spoke of truths that they hold
    then said "go out and tell every-one"

testimony of 8

    consider this tale of 8 guys
    whose witnessing never will die
    they saw things that amazed
    on some ancient gold plates
    and its heft they just couldn't deny!

testimony of joseph

    in september of eighteen-two-three
    by his bed, Joe an angel did see
    spoke of breastplates and bows
    and of plates made of gold
    and the stones that allowed him to read

    so on the west side of some hill
    joseph searched all the places until
    when he got to the spot
    he instantly thought
    here i'll find the stone box laying still

Nephi

    Nephi had good parents who thought
    that good things to their kids should be taught
    so a book he did write
    which would lead us to Light
    and he used his own life as the plot

    Now Lehi was Nephi's old dad
    who tells of a vision he had
    seeing God on his throne,
    One whose countenance shone,
    and twelve stars sharing news that was glad

    The One gave to Lehi a book
    which, when read, said Jerusalem shook
    called them out for their sin
    said their peace would soon end
    lest their hearts back to YHVH would look

    - time to move
    - dwelt in a tent

Jacob
    said Jacob that Father Lehi
    once said before he did die
    God did not want to see
    them live po-ly-ga-my
    lest their women and children should cry

    we are told that old Zenos did see
    the LORD's vineyard (in allegory)
    he distributes the tame
    just to bring back again
    all in hopes to not loose his loved tree

Enos

    En-os got to thinking one day
    about life, and the joy of the saints
    so he prayed day and night
    and he begged with his might
    that this book to the la'mnites 'twould make 

Jarom

    then said jarom on plates that were small
    what more could i write? they've said all
    what's been written you see
    it sufficeth me
    Then admonished his people, like paul

Omni

    To Omni said Jarom, (his dad):
    that he to the record should add
    so from father to son
    some who nearly said none,
    'til no heir to the record was had


Words of Mormon...

    said Mormon: to me it seems wise,
    along with the book of Lehi
    from the large plates i'll bring
    all the records of kings 
    yet, include the small plates of Nephi.
